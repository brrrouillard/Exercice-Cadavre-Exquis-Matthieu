# The Princess and the Frog
*Once upon a time...* there was a princess who lived in the country of **Becodia**.
Since she was a child, she was waiting for *someone* to bring her the **secrets of Web Development** book to prove his love.
This was a very, *very*, **very** old book, which was guarded by a dragon called **Javascript**.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### On the other side of the *mountain*, a young prince was preparing *himself* to leave his *hometown* and search for his **beloved** one.

### He went through *oceans* and **forests** to find the book of the **secrets of Web Developpement**.

### Until one day he found the **cave** where the drangon was hiding the *precious* book.  
=======
So a knight came, armed with his flaming **keyboard sword** and firewall **shield**, determined to deliver the book to the princess so that they could code together forever and make plenty of websites. He travelled long and far in the lands of *google* until he reached the dragon's lair.
